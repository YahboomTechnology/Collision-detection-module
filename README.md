# Introduction
Collision detection module is a commonly used switching element. It uses the collision of moving parts to make the metal sheet open and close to control whether the circuit is turned on. When circuit is in ON-state, OUT pin of this module will output high level, otherwise it output low level. In addition, it can also be used for collision detection, travel limit, and can also be used as an ordinary switch.
# Features
* High sensitivity for collision detection.
* Three connection methods: alligator clip, DuPont line and PH2.0 cable.
* Support common controllers on the market, such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Micro:bit, etc.
* By programming, it can realize your creative idea, such as elevator limit detection, robot obstacle avoidance.
